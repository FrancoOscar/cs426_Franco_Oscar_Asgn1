## A Simple Ball Shooting Game Using Unity3D

### Description of My Game
When I think of home, I envision my backyard, where I spent a significant part of my childhood playing soccer. Growing up, soccer was a significant part of my life, and this game pays homage to that part of my life. Following the requirements for this game, BB8 is present at all times, and the camera will follow him. For decor, I have added a tree and a building with an additional roof, satisfying the three 3D object requirements. There are five targets the player must hit to win the game, and they also have an unlimited number of attempts to do so, keeping track of this on the scoreboard. The player will not go through walls, fall over, or move back when shooting, and balls will change direction when they collide with an object. For 2D textures, I have two different kinds of fences, a brick texture, and a grass texture on the ground.
